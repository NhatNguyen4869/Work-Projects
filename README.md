VIETNAMESE NAME CLASSIFIER

This project is designed to identify Vietnamese customers based on their names, even when the names are partially or fully Westernized (e.g., Nguyen David, Pham Hoang Charlet).
The goal is to provide a lightweight and practical tool for classifying names with a high likelihood of Vietnamese origin in customer databases or user lists

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Vietnamese names can appear in various formats, especially in multicultural environments or among individuals with international exposure. This model attempts to:
- Detect Vietnamese-origin names from mixed or Westernized formats.
- Improve targeting or segmentation in customer analytics.
- Support use cases like localized marketing, data enrichment, and user profiling.

DATA SOURCE
The dataset used for training and validation is compiled from publicly available sources, including:
- Lists of student names published by Vietnamese universities.
- Public university enrollment data.
- Making up
- Lists of actors, actresses, and public figures available online.
⚠️ Note: All data used was publicly accessible and used for academic and research purposes only. No private or sensitive data was used.
